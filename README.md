# ThreeJS_visuals   
                                       
Project Type: A collection of interactive 3D visualizations and simulations built using Three.js. The projects range from simple geometric shapes to more complex simulations like fluid dynamics and physics-based interactions.                                       

Tech Stack:
- Three.js: A JavaScript 3D library.
- HTML: For structuring the web pages.
- CSS: For styling the web pages.
- JavaScript: For implementing the application logic and Three.js interactions.
- dat.GUI: A lightweight graphical user interface for changing variables in JavaScript.
- Rapier: A 3D physics engine (used in one example).
- OrbitControls: A Three.js control for orbiting the camera around a target.
- GLSL (Shaders): Implicitly used within Three.js for custom material effects.
